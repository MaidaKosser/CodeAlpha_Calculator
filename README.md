## ▶ Usage
- Click number buttons to enter digits.

- Use +, -, ×, ÷ to build expressions.

- Press = or Enter to calculate the result.

- Use C to clear the last entry and AC to clear everything.

- Decimal point . supported for fractional numbers.

- (If implemented) Use keyboard: digits, + - * /, Enter (=), Backspace.

## 💡 Implementation Notes / Tips:
- Use eval carefully — prefer a safe parser or sanitize input before evaluation.

- Handle divide-by-zero cases gracefully (show Error or warning).

- Prevent multiple consecutive operators (e.g., 5++2) — replace the previous operator instead.

- Keep UI accessible: focus states on buttons and proper aria-labels for screen readers.
